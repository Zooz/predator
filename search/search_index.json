The Create Test API request body must include all components that make up a test, including pre-scenario requests and scenarios. However, instead of defining the entire HTTP request in each scenario step (as you would through the Predator UI), you can now reference the HTTP request through its DSL definition. You do so, using the <code>action</code> property (in the <code>steps</code> array). </p> <p>Here's an example:</p> <pre><code>{\n\"name\": \"Pet store\",\n\"description\": \"DSL\",\n\"type\": \"dsl\", // Make sure the type is set to DSL\n\"before\": {\n\"steps\": [\n{\n\"action\": \"petstore.create-pet\"\n}   ]\n},\n\"scenarios\": [\n{\n\"scenario_name\": \"Only get pet\",\n\"steps\": [\n{\n\"action\": \"petstore.get-pet\"\n}   ]\n}\n]\n}\n</code></pre> <p>There are two additional items to note:</p> <ul> <li> <p>The <code>type</code> must always be set to <code>dsl</code>.</p> </li> <li> <p>The <code>action</code> value uses the following syntax: <code>{dsl_group}.{dsl_name}</code>, in which the <code>dsl_group</code> is the name used in the path of the Create DSL Definition API request. </p> </li> </ul> <p>If you login to the Predator UI after creating the test, you will notice that the test has been added with a type of dsl. </p> <p>You can now run the test as you would any other. </p> <p></p>"},{"location":"tests.html#creating-a-test-with-custom-logic-in-javascript-released-in-version-120","title":"Creating a Test with Custom Logic in Javascript (Released in version 1.2.0)","text":"<p>Tests can use custom Javascript functions.
