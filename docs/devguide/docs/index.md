# Introducing Predator

**An open-source high performance testing framework**

Requests per second, request latency, and overall system performance and reliability are some fundamental concepts that need to be taken into account when designing a high capacity API. With CI/CD becoming a common deployment methodology, deployments to production are a constant occurrence. So how can you ensure that the core capabilities you initially designed your system to have remain intact? 

The answer is: use Predator! 

Predator is a performance framework that can be configured to automatically load your API with scheduled tests that provide in-depth performance metrics. While sipping on your (morning) coffee, you can simply check the test summaries to make sure your system is performing as expected. By comparing test results to results from previous test runs, you can easily identify system-wide regressions. Predatorâ€™s integration with custom dashboards, test metrics, and service logs make pinpointing performance bugs painless,especially when you check up on the system on a daily basis.


The following features guided us throughout our development, and they shape the core ideology of Predator.
