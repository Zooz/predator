## Scheduled Jobs

Predator creates scheduled jobs for all tests that are configured to run at predefined intervals by specifying a `cron expression`. 
To see the scheduled jobs that are registered, choose **Scheduled Jobs**

### Enable/Disable
Disable or enable back a scheduled job easily through the UI to have more control over the scheduled jobs. 

## Test Reports

Predator's test reports give in-depth performance metrics in real-time, while aggregating test results to an overall RPS and success rate.

### Comparing Reports

!!! TIP "Supported from version zooz/predator:1.3.0"

Easily compare two or more test results in one predator report dashboard. This is available under `Last Reports` page 
and after selecting the desired tests, clicking on `Compare Reports` will display the test results side by side on the same graphs.
