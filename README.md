Predator is an open-source distributed performance testing framework. Predator manages the entire lifecycle of stress-testing a server, 
from creating a test file, to running scheduled and on-demand tests, and finally viewing the test results in a highly informative report. 
Bootstrapped with a user-friendly UI alongside a simple REST API, Predator helps developers simplify the performance testing regime.
