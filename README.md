Predator manages the entire lifecycle of stress-testing servers, from creating performance tests, to running these tests on a scheduled and on-demand basis, and finally viewing the test results in a highly informative and live report.

It has a simple, one-click installation, built with support for Kubernetes, DC/OS and Docker Engine, and can persist the created performance tests and their reports in 5 different databases. It also supports running distributed load out of the box. Bootstrapped with a user-friendly UI alongside a simple REST API, Predator helps developers simplify the performance testing regime.

|-------------------------------- |:------------------:|:---------|
| Distributed Load                | :sparkle:          |Predator supports an unlimited number of load generators that produce multiple load runners concurrently.
| Functional Testing              | :new:              |Run functional tests with various types of assertions and later on see the results in the report page.
| Rich UI                         | :sparkle:          |Predator offers a rich UI where you can write tests, run them and compare results.
| Reports && Tests Persistence    | :sparkle:          |Predator provides out-of-the box functionality for persisting data in Postgres, MySQL, MSSQL and SQLITE.
| Real time reports               | :sparkle:          |Predator aggregates all concurrent runs into a single beautiful report in real time (latency, rps, status codes and more).
| CSV Datasets                    | :sparkle:          |Predator support uploading files like csv to provide dataset for test inputs
| Scheduled runs                  | :sparkle:          |Predator can run recurring tests using cron expressions.
| REST API                        | :sparkle:          |Full REST API to integrate Predator with CI/CD frameworks
| Benchmarks                      | :sparkle:          |Set benchmarks to compare test runs to ensure performance degradation is discovered early in development. Allows to measure every build and release against specified baseline results guaranteeing safer releases to production.|
| Cloud Native                    | :sparkle:          |Predator is built to take advantage of Kubernetes and DC/OS. It's integrated with those platforms and can manage the load generators lifecycles by itself.
| Prometheus/Influx integration   | :sparkle:          |Predator comes integrated with Prometheus and Influx. Simply configure it through the predator REST API or using the UI.
| Compare Multiple tests results  | :sparkle:          |Built-in dashboard to compare multiple test runs at once.
| Webhooks API                    | :new:              |supported in Slack, Microsoft Teams, or JSON format for an easy server to server integration.

## Major Updates Notes
### v1.5.0 - Breaking changes
#### DB Support
1. Predator's support of **Cassandra** will be dropped. Before opensourcing Predator and using an ORM abstraction in order to support multiple databases, Predator was only integrated with Cassandra as a backend storage. Since Cassandra's pros are not fully leveraged in the usecases of Predator's integration with a database and because it was delaying our development on new features, we decided to fully drop support of it. We plan to provide migration scripts to our other supported databases.  

#### Jobs API
2. Functional tests support will break the `POST /jobs` API. A new parameter `type` to the create job body will be added and will require either a value of `load_test` or `functional_test`, check out our [API documentation](https://zooz.github.io/predator/indexapiref.html#operation/create-a-job) for more details.
3. New Webhooks API will break the current webhooks feature implemented in <= v1.4. `POST /jobs` API will now include in the body `webhook_id` field instead of `webhook_url`.

## Getting Started

### Important Deployment Tips
Predator is production ready and fully tested and can be deployed in all of the following platforms listed. Please follow these guidelines when deploying Predator:
1. Deploy Predator using only tagged releases and not `latest`.
2. Predator-Runner docker image version (`zooz/predator-runner:$TAGGED_VERSION`) must match the Predator's `major.minor` version running in order to be fully compatible with all features. Patched versions don't have to match, but it is recommended to use latest patch version.
    - For example, Predator version 1.6 (`zooz/predator:1.6`) should run Predator-Runner version 1.6 as well (`zooz/predator-runner:1.6`). 

### Kubernetes
Predator is designed to seamlessly deploy into your Kubernetes cluster. Install Predator from the [Helm Hub](https://hub.helm.sh/charts/zooz/predator)

### DC/OS
Predator is included in Mesosphere Universe. Please refer to https://universe.dcos.io/#/package/predator/version/latest for a quick start guide and examples for installing the package.

### Docker

Without persisted storage:

```docker run -d -e JOB_PLATFORM=DOCKER -e INTERNAL_ADDRESS=http://$MACHINE_IP:80/v1 -p 80:80 --name predator -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock zooz/predator```

With persisted storage:

```docker run -d -e SQLITE_STORAGE=db/predator -e JOB_PLATFORM=DOCKER -e INTERNAL_ADDRESS=http://$MACHINE_IP:80/v1 -p 80:80 --name predator -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock -v /tmp/predator:/usr/db zooz/predator```

where $MACHINE_IP is the local ip address of your machine (not localhost, but actual ip address - it is your local network address).

## Developers
To run and debug Predator locally run: 

```sh
npm run setup-local-env
```

This script will clean your node_modules, run npm install, build the ui (webpack) and set .env file with minimal required params.   
After that you will be able to start Predator with:

```sh
npm run start-local
```

In case your IP changes, you will need to change it in .env file.

#### Developing frontend with hot reload
```sh
cd ui
PREDATOR_URL=http://localhost:3000/v1 npm start
```
#### Running the tests

```sh
npm test
```
The script runs the following tests:

* lint
* unit-tests
* integration-tests

## Opening the Predator UI
The path for accessing the Predator UI is: http://localhost:3000/ui (in the case that Predator is running locally under port 3000)
<br>

In case Predator is not running under the root domain, (for example, running under http://your.domain.com/example-path) in order to access the UI follow the below steps:
1. `docker build --build-arg BUCKET_PATH=example-path . -t predator`
2. Deploy the tagged docker image to your preferred platform
3. Access the Predator UI at http://your.domain.com/example-path/ui

In case you host Predator's docs website on a different URL ( for example, Predator runs in a closed network without access to the internet ) you can configure the docs link in the UI using the PREDATOR_DOCS_URL build-arg.
if PREDATOR_DOCS_URL was not specified, the default value is `https://zooz.github.io/predator`.

1. `docker build --build-arg PREDATOR_DOCS_URL=http://your.predator.docs.com/example-path . -t predator`
2. Deploy the tagged docker image to your preferred platform
3. One should be redirected to `http://your.predator.docs.com/example-path` when clicking the on the docs link in the UI side menu.
