Predator manages the entire lifecycle of stress-testing servers, from creating performance tests, to running these tests on a scheduled and on-demand basis, and finally viewing the test results in a highly informative and live report.

It has a simple, one-click installation, built with support for Kubernetes, DC/OS and Docker Engine, and can persist the created performance tests and their reports in 5 different databases. It also supports running distributed load out of the box. Bootstrapped with a user-friendly UI alongside a simple REST API, Predator helps developers simplify the performance testing regime.

## Features
- **Distributed load**:  Predator supports an unlimited number of load generators that produce multiple load runners concurrently.

- **Real time reports**: Predator aggregates all concurrent runs into a single beautiful report in real time (latency, rps, status codes and more).

- **Built for the cloud**:  Predator is built to take advantage of Kubernetes and DC/OS. It's integrated with those platforms and can manage the load generators lifecycles by itself.

- **One click installation**:  Predator can be installed with just one click in Kubernetes and DC/OS, or on any other machine running Docker.

- **Supports 5 Different databases**: Predator provides out-of-the box functionality for persisting data in Cassandra, Postgres, MySQL, MSSQL and SQLITE.

- **Scheduled jobs**: Predator can run recurring tests using cron expressions.

- **3rd partry metrics**: Predator comes integrated with Prometheus and Influx. Simply configure it through the predator REST API or using the UI.

- **Rich UI**: Predator offers a rich UI along with a powerful REST API.

- **Based on [artillery.io](https://artillery.io/docs/http-reference)**: Predator uses artillery as its 
load engine to fire the requests. The schema for creating tests via the Predator REST API is based on the artillery schema.


## System Overview

## Getting Started

### Kubernetes
Predator is designed to seamlessly deploy into your Kubernetes cluster. Install Predator from the [Helm Hub](https://hub.helm.sh/charts/zooz/predator)

### DC/OS
Predator is included in Mesosphere Universe. Please refer to https://universe.dcos.io/#/package/predator/version/latest for a quick start guide and examples for installing the package.

### Docker
`docker run -d -e JOB_PLATFORM=DOCKER -e INTERNAL_ADDRESS=http://$MACHINE_IP:80/v1 -p 80:80 --name predator -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock zooz/predator`

where $MACHINE_IP=local ip address of your machine

### Developers
Predator runs using Docker. In order to run Predator locally, clone this repository and then run the following command:

`runPredatorLocal.sh`

or refer to the [Docker](#docker) instructions above.

##### Running the tests

Run `npm test` in order to run tests in your local machine. The script runs the following tests:
* lint
* unit-tests
* integration-tests

## Opening the Predator UI
The path for accessing the Predator UI is: http://localhost/ui (in the case that Predator is running locally under port 80)
<br>

In case Predator is not running under the root domain, (for example, running under http://your.domain.com/example-path) in order to access the UI follow the below steps:
1. `docker build --build-arg BUCKET_PATH=example-path . -t predator`
2. Deploy the tagged docker image to your preferred platform
3. Access the Predator UI at http://your.domain.com/example-path/ui

In case you host Predator's docs website on a different URL ( for example, Predator runs in a closed network without access to the internet ) you can configure the docs link in the UI using the PREDATOR_DOCS_URL build-arg.
if PREDATOR_DOCS_URL was not specified, the default value is `https://zooz.github.io/predator`.

1. `docker build --build-arg PREDATOR_DOCS_URL=http://your.predator.docs.com/example-path . -t predator`
2. Deploy the tagged docker image to your preferred platform
3. One should be redirected to `http://your.predator.docs.com/example-path` when clicking the on the docs link in the UI side menu.
